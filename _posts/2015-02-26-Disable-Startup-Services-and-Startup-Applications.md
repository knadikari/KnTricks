Startup services are programs that run on the back ground in the system. you can’t see them running like applications. So when disabling them be extremely sure what you are doing because it will be harmful for the system.
1. Type ” msconfig ” in search bar of the start menu and enter. You can also use “Ctrl + R” and open the run window and type ” msconfig ” and enter.
2. Now click on services tab.
3. Before disabling any services I highly recommend to tick the “hide all Microsoft services” option.
